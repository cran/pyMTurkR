\usage{
GrantBonus(workers, assignments, amounts, reasons, skip.prompt = FALSE,
  unique.request.token = NULL, verbose = getOption("pyMTurkR.verbose",
  TRUE))
}
\arguments{
\item{workers}{A character string containing a WorkerId, or a vector of
character strings containing multiple WorkerIds.}

\item{assignments}{A character string containing an AssignmentId for an
assignment performed by that worker, or a vector of character strings
containing the AssignmentId for an assignment performed by each of the
workers specified in \code{workers}.}

\item{amounts}{A character string containing an amount (in U.S. Dollars) to
bonus the worker(s), or a vector (of length equal to the number of workers)
of character strings containing the amount to be paid to each worker.}

\item{reasons}{A character string containing a reason for bonusing the
worker(s), or a vector (of length equal to the number of workers) of
character strings containing the reason to bonus each worker. The reason is
visible to each worker and is sent via email.}

\item{skip.prompt}{A logical indicating whether to skip the prompt that
asks you to continue when duplicate AssignmentIds are found. If TRUE, you will
not be asked to confirm. The prompt is a safeguard flag to protect the user from
mistakenly paying a bonus twice.}

\item{unique.request.token}{An optional character string, included only for
advanced users. It can be used to prevent resending a bonus. A bonus will
not be granted if a bonus was previously granted (within a short time
window) using the same \code{unique.request.token}.}

\item{verbose}{Optionally print the results of the API request to the
standard output. Default is taken from \code{getOption('pyMTurkR.verbose',
TRUE)}.}
}
\value{
A data frame containing the WorkerId, AssignmentId, amount, reason,
and whether each request to bonus was valid.
}
\description{
Pay a bonus to one or more workers. This function spends money from your
MTurk account and will fail if insufficient funds are available.
}
\details{
A simple function to grant a bonus to one or more workers. The function is
somewhat picky in that it requires a WorkerId, the AssignmentId for an
assignment that worker has completed, an amount, and a reason for the bonus,
for each bonus to be paid. Optionally, the amount and reason can be
specified as single (character string) values, which will be used for each
bonus.

\code{bonus()}, \code{paybonus()}, and \code{sendbonus()} are aliases.
